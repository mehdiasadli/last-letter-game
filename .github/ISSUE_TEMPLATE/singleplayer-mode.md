## ðŸŽ® Singleplayer Mode Enhancement

### Description

Add a singleplayer mode where a single player attempts to complete an entire word pack by finding all available words. This mode will provide a different gameplay experience focused on vocabulary mastery and personal achievement rather than competitive elimination.

### Problem Statement

Currently, Last Letter only supports multiplayer gameplay where players compete against each other. This limits the game's appeal to:

- Players who want to practice alone
- Users who want to test their vocabulary knowledge
- Players who prefer solo challenges
- Educational settings where individual learning is preferred

### Proposed Solution

Implement a singleplayer mode with the following features:

#### Core Gameplay

- **Single Player**: One player plays against the word pack
- **Word Completion Goal**: Player must find all available words in the pack
- **No Elimination**: Player continues until all words are found or they give up
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bar showing completion percentage
- **Timer Options**: Configurable timer per word (optional)

#### Game Flow

1. **Mode Selection**: Add "Singleplayer" option on start page
2. **Pack Selection**: Choose word pack (Countries, US States, etc.)
3. **Settings**: Configure timer duration (optional, can be disabled)
4. **Gameplay**: Player finds words one by one
5. **Completion**: Game ends when all words are found or player quits
6. **Results**: Show completion statistics and performance metrics

#### UI/UX Features

- **Progress Indicator**: Show "X/Y words completed"
- **Completion Percentage**: Visual progress bar
- **Word Counter**: Display remaining words count
- **Performance Stats**: Time taken, words per minute, accuracy
- **Achievement System**: Badges for completing packs
- **Difficulty Levels**: Easy (no timer), Medium (timer), Hard (strict timer)

### User Story

As a **solo player**, I want to **challenge myself to complete entire word packs** so that I can **improve my vocabulary and test my knowledge** without needing other players.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Singleplayer mode option available on start page
- [ ] Player can select word pack for singleplayer mode
- [ ] Game tracks progress through the word pack
- [ ] Visual progress indicator shows completion status
- [ ] Game ends when all words are found or player quits
- [ ] Results page shows completion statistics
- [ ] Timer can be enabled/disabled for singleplayer mode
- [ ] Performance metrics are displayed (time, accuracy, etc.)
- [ ] Achievement system for completing packs
- [ ] Responsive design works on all devices

### Additional Context

This enhancement will:

- **Expand User Base**: Appeal to solo players and educational users
- **Increase Engagement**: Provide a different challenge type
- **Educational Value**: Help users learn vocabulary systematically
- **Accessibility**: Allow play without requiring multiple players

### Implementation Notes

#### Technical Considerations

- **State Management**: Extend game store to handle singleplayer state
- **Routing**: Add `/singleplayer` route and related pages
- **Progress Tracking**: Store completion progress in localStorage
- **Timer Logic**: Modify existing timer system for singleplayer use
- **Word Validation**: Reuse existing word validation logic
- **Statistics**: Create new statistics tracking for singleplayer mode

#### UI Components Needed

- **Mode Selection**: Add singleplayer option to start page
- **Singleplayer Game Page**: Similar to multiplayer but with progress focus
- **Progress Display**: Show completion percentage and remaining words
- **Singleplayer Results**: Display completion statistics and achievements

#### Data Structure Changes

```typescript
// Extend game store for singleplayer
interface SingleplayerGameState {
  mode: 'singleplayer' | 'multiplayer';
  progress: {
    completedWords: string[];
    totalWords: number;
    completionPercentage: number;
  };
  statistics: {
    startTime: Date;
    endTime?: Date;
    totalTime?: number;
    wordsPerMinute?: number;
  };
}
```
